While I may start strong, I would always eventaully fall off with posting things to the blog. Eventually, my personal site just turned into a landing page with links out to other places where I'm active or would post things.</p><p>But now I'm going to give it another shot. I've worked on a couple of different projects recently where I've thought to myself "you know, no one's really talked about building something like this. I should write about it." I've also got a number of projects planned where I could see there being some interesting topics to write about. But my current website doesn't really allow for writing things. So I rebuilt it.</p><p>The new site is built using John Sundell's <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a>. It's a static site generator built with Swift that can (among other things) process Markdown files to build a website consiting of a bunch of HTML files. Pretty much par for the course if you're used to other static site generators like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.</p><p>The nice thing about Publish being written in Swift is that I know Swift, which means I can easily extend it if I need to. I've already done a number of custom things to build this website and make the experience of developing the site a little bit nicer. Some of those things, I plan to write about here and even potentially open source for others to use.</p><p>So, that's that. Though I have several more things I want to do with this website, it's now in a state where I can start writing things, so here's a first post to kick it off. I've got a lot of topic ideas to write about, so I'm hoping to stick with this to be able to cover all of those topics. We'll see how well I can do.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
